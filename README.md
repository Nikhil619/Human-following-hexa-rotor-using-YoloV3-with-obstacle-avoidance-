# Human-following-hexa-rotor-using-YoloV3-with-obstacle-avoidance-

## Implemented YoloV3 and StereoVision based obstacle detection (and range sensor based obstacle detection) in a hexa-rotor to make it follow humans and avoid obstacles by giving the desired velocity vector (V_x, V_y and V_z). The cameras detect obstacles(using disparity maps). The velocity vector is passed to the flight controller
