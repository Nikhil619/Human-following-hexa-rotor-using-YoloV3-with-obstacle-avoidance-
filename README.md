# Human-following-hexa-rotor-using-YoloV3-with-obstacle-avoidance-

## Implemented YoloV3 in a hexa-rotor to make it follow humans and the hexa-rotor avoids obstacles by turning the desired velocity vector into V_x, V_y and V_z when the sensors or cameras detect any obstacles. Also the motion of the robot is given by V_x, V_y and V_z
